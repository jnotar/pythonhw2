#Exercise 4.6.1 in PCFB

# How many times will 'hello' be printed?
1) 14
2) 4
3) 5
4) 5
5) 8

#What does fooXX do? 
1) Creates a function that takes the square root of x
2) Creates a function that prints/returns x if x is larger than y, and y if x is not larger than y
3) Creates a function that changes the order of three numbers given to the function:
	The first if switches x and y, if x is greater than y
	The second if switches the new y and z, if y is greater than z
	The third if switches the new y and new x, if x is greater than y
Then the funciton returns the 3 numbers in the last order. 
4) Creates a function that returns a factorial of x 
5) Creates a function that returns, via a different mathematical route, a factorial of x
